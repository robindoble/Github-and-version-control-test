upstream remote is mearly the way of linking an existing local repo with a remote repo on github - whereas a clone would create a new local file system, remote simply creates a distributed connection between local and remote repos. this is particularly useful when one doesnt have collaborator permissions to a repo and they thus need to fork and clone their own github fork - but when pulling in changes from the original repo if public, typically called upstream, not origin which is how poeple generally reference the forked version, one needs to create a second github connection using the remote methodology
