branching enables one to copy the current git repo to another branchand make whatever additional changes they wish. typically it is used to test development changes without disturbing the live version of the software. when changes are complete it is possible to merge this branch with the master, ironing out any merge conflicts, and that way implementing the changes to the live site. it is also possible to checkout a previously commited local repo by use of a hash tag - this would mean entering a detached head state where you are no longer working with the most recent version of the repo. one needs to be careful about how they navigate, make changes, merge etc
